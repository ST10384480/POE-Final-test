Notes on Security/UX

- The JWT is stored in `localStorage` and attached via an Axios request
  interceptor; a 401 response clears it automatically so the app falls back
  to a logged-out state instead of looping on stale tokens.
- API error messages shown to the user always go through
  `apiErrorMessage()`, which only ever surfaces the backend's own
  human-readable `message` field — never raw error objects, stack traces, or
  HTTP internals.
- Invalid input (empty fields, bad email format) is caught client-side
  before a request is even sent, in addition to the server-side validation
  that is the actual security boundary.
